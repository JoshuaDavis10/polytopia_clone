TILEMAP STUFF:

BUG FIXES:
( ) werid zoom bug where it snaps to tiles

( ) sometimes tile selection doesn't work properly. Mostly near edges? every other tile?


UPDATES TO MAKE:
(X) refactoring:
	-> mouse update should only be happening on a mouse click and honestly it's sole purpose is to determine which tile was clicked (i.e. you don't
		have to store literally all the mouse data into the game state)

(X) pixel art for every tiletype in polytopia (including water! Don't wimp out! ALSO a village sprite)
	-> again taller sprites will have to offset when drawn (this will have to be handled in draw_tilemap or whatever).

( ) re-implement random map generation/loading maps to and from files

( ) basic UI to create a new game (generate random map) or load saved game (load from file) or save current game (save to file)... idk you'll figure
it out when you get here lol

( ) click and drag for map panning

( ) mouse-scroll wheel for zooming

( ) only redraw screen when state changes in some way!!!!! save computation

GET ALL THAT DONE BY SATURDAY ^^^
