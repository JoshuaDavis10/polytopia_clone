TILEMAP STUFF:
- refactor everything that you've already done so that it's more cohesive (i.e. some stuff you did was kind of slapped on or janky as you realized
what you needed)
	-> things to consider while doing this:
		-> should probably make vec2 have int components cuz you rlly never need doubles (you're constantly
		typecasting to ints anyway)
		-> mouse update should only be happening on a mouse click and honeslty it's sole purpose is to determine which tile was clicked (i.e. you don't
		have to store literally all the mouse data into the game state)
		-> the way you draw tilemap may have to change if sprite height is weird (due to like a tree being on the tile) and will have to offset based
		on that?
		-> panning and zooming is a planned feature 
		-> ...

- pan and zoom functionality

*********************************
- refactor after you finish pan and zoom!!!!

- pixel art for every tiletype in polytopia (including water! Don't wimp out! ALSO a village sprite)
	-> again taller sprites will have to offset when drawn (this will have to be handled in draw_tilemap or whatever).

- re-implement random map generation/loading maps to and from files

- basic UI to create a new game (generate random map) or load saved game (load from file) or save current game (save to file)... idk you'll figure
it out when you get here lol

- click and drag for map panning

- mouse-scroll wheel for zooming

- only redraw screen when state changes in some way!!!!! save computation
