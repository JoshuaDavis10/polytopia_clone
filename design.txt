POLYTOPIA CLONE!

Basically, ima just remake polytopia...

Here are the design stages that I plan... obviously I don't have a great idea of what I am doing:
	1) Tiling System: make sure you have a super robust tile system with different types, positioning info, 
	   adjacency information... etc... <-those are just a few random things I though of just now. 
	2) Unit System: super robust unit system... off the top of my head: movement (depends on tile system heavily), 
	   types, attacking/defending
	3) Turn System: game consists of turns that affect when units move yk... I just need this set up so that
	   cities/income actually make sense.
	4) Cities: income, build units
	5) Environment: implement tile types, resources, (hold off on water for a while lol)
	6) City Leveling: now that environment resources exist, implement harvesting system that levels cities!
	
	after this core ^^^ is set up:
	- pathfinding based on environment (mountains, water, enemies, etc...)
	- water and boats
	- enemies/AI
	- multiplayer

	I seriously doubt that you will get most if any of those done ^^
