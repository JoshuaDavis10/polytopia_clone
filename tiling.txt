TILING SYSTEM NOTES!

TODO:

- figure out collision detection for the isometric tiles.

- I feel like the way the width and height and different ratios for zoom and camera and all that is kinda janky. Now that you have a full
  understanding of it, I think it's a good idea to go back and refactor a lot of the tilemap stuff at some point.
 
- REFACTOR. Get rid of all TODOs that you can.

DELIVERABLE:
- drawing of tilemap is isometric with pixel art tiles of each different type 
- function camera movement and zoom
- ability to select tiles. Visual indicator of selected tile.
